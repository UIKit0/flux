1 - Query Format
==============================
The system daemons use a text based query format like many databases. A query is 
a series of commands separated by semicolons. A command is made of a command 
name and some number of arguments, separated by whitespace (tabs or spaces). A
command is terminated by a null byte, as well as specified in size by the
request structure.

A request does however have more power than most database queries. It can be
thought of instead like a simple script. It can create and set variables via
the 'set' command that hold the address of a single filesystem structure. It
can specify the data sent in the reply to the caller using the 'ret' command
as well.

To specify a specific file or directory, three different addressing schemes
may be used. The first is the standard UNIX format, with the '/' character as
a separator. If the path begins with a '/', it is absolute; otherwise, it is
relative to an "org" command specified earlier in the same request. The root
directory is specified as a single point, and other filesystems are 'mounted'
at different positions in the filesystem heirarchy. The second has a similar
format, but is relative to a specific device instead of the root - each device
is specified either by its driver's hexadecimal PID or an arbitrarily assigned 
device letter. The third specifies both a device and a hexadecimal value
representing a specific file or directory - an "inode" in UNIX parlance. These
are in order from slowest to fastest in terms of transaction speed and brevity.

To locate a filesystem structure within a directory, a regular expression can
be used to search using the 'find' command. These regular expressions are in
Flux standard format, specified in Section 8 of the User Manual.

Here is an example of a query:

org /home/flux
