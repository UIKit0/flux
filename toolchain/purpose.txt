The Aether Virtual Machine

Aether is a virtual machine bytecode specification, used frequently 
within the Khaos operating system's utilities. It is intended to work 
closely with real machine code, and even act as an abstract machine code 
intermediate in compilation. One of the goals is to allow a platform 
independent way to write self modifying and dynamic code. Another is as 
a common, fast extension format for various tools, after being compiled 
from a human readable language.
