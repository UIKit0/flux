SLIP: Lambdas, Iterators, and Pointers

SLIP is a small and fast compiled semi-functional language designed for 
use on Khaos. It is in many ways a Lisp dialect: most of its syntax is 
based on Lisp. However, it also has extensions that make system 
programming faster and easier, including iterators and pointer 
arithmetic. It also has a weak static type system similar to C's for 
accurate manipulation of data and type safety in library interfaces. 
SLIP is also designed to run with no garbage collection or other 
runtime dependencies, and is therefore suitable for any system layer. The 
current specification is undergoing rapid changes, so not much progress 
will be made beyond the lexer and parser for now.
