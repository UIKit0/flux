libQILL - The QILL Integrated LLVM Library

This will be a simplified LLVM library implementation, written in C, 
that allows the use of LLVM bitcode as a dynamically loadable tool 
extension format, as well as it's normal uses. It is intended to 
facilitate the construction of a drop in replacement for the LLVM/Clang 
toolchain, independent of C++ and the LLVM build system, which will 
serve as the standard Khaos toolchain.

Said toolchain will remain fully interoperable with LLVM, and most 
likely not surpass it in speed, but instead in code simplicity and 
degree of integration into the Khaos system. The intent is *not* to 
compete directly with LLVM.
