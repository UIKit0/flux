	- tested: VirtualBox OSE 2.2.2, on Celeron-M (PIII clone)

===========================

Build Instructions:

To make each piece of the operating system, simply type "make 
<subproject>", or just "make" to make everything. The kernel, libsys, 
init, libc, and at least basic drivers must be built for the system to 
boot correctly. Aether and coreutils are required for normal operation. 
Libc and aether contain headers linked to by coreutils, so coreutils must 
be updated after both of them are rebuilt. "make -C <subproject> clean" 
will remove all object files from the subprojects' directories.

Test Instructions:

To test the operating system, use "make test". This will make 
it run in a virtual machine: Bochs. run/bochsrc.txt is the 
configuration file for Bochs - modify it to your liking.
