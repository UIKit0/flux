===============================

Build Instructions:

To make each piece of the operating system, simply type "make 
<subproject>", or just "make" to make everything. The kernel, init, 
libc, and at least basic drivers must be built for the system to boot 
correctly. "make -C <subproject> clean" will remove all object files 
from the subprojects' directories, and "make clean" will remove all 
object files.

Test Instructions:

To test the operating system, use "make test". This will make 
it run in a virtual machine: Bochs. run/bochsrc.txt is the 
configuration file for Bochs - modify it to your liking.
